# Advent of code 2022

## Context

This is the code I wrote to find the solution to the challenges of the 2022
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) calendar.

I started learning Rust a few weeks ago with my colleagues. We are carefully
going through [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
So the Advent of Code is a great way to make myself comfortable with writing
Rust programs, in terms of quantity rather than quality for now. This, and the
nature of the challenge (who's got time for refactoring when you have to
complete a challenge everyday + work full time + run around trying to get
christmas presents for everyone) explain why the code may not be very idiomatic,
and why there is no consideration for performance of the algorithms.

I hope I look back a this code later and cringe.

## Run

Each folder contains a program that outputs the solution for the challenge of
the given day and the input file I was given so that you can run the program.

cd into a day's folder and run `cargo run` to get the answer to the challenge.
